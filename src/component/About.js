      <p className="fs-5 fn-2 text-center">Back in 2021, when I started college with big ambitions, my friends and I made the decision to rent a flat instead of staying in the college hostel. However, as exciting as it was to begin this new chapter, we quickly encountered a major challenge: preparing meals that were both filling and healthy. It wasn’t a matter of time, but rather a lack of knowledge. We had no idea what to cook or how to go about it. Some days, we went without eating or resorted to junk food, completely unaware of the long-term effects it could have on our health.</p>

      <p className="fs-5 fn-2 text-center">n desperation, we got creative—by crashing weddings. At night, we would gather on the terrace, scan the horizon for wedding lights, and then set off in search of them. We’d sneak in, enjoy a hearty meal, and leave quietly, with full stomachs and a bit of mischief.</p>

      <p className="fs-5 fn-2 text-center">After graduating, I realized how common this struggle is for students who move far from home in pursuit of their dreams. That’s what inspired me to create a website designed to help students facing similar challenges with food. The website offers a variety of healthy, easy-to-make recipes—covering breakfast, lunch, dinner, desserts, and more—to make cooking accessible and enjoyable for them.</p>
